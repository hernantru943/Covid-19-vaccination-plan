# Covid-19 vaccination plan - Project

# Analysis purpose:

How to increase the Covid-19 vaccinated population in low income neighborhoods in NY with a vaccination plan throughout the MTA system.

# Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

Client: we have been asked to deliver a preliminary analysis for a non profit organization called Foundation for Morristown Medical Center, who will improve tremendously its resources effectiveness on organizing the logistic of their "Vaccination points" in NY by identifying the bussiest stations by day an hour to get as many vaccinated population as possible in low income communities. 

The Foundation for Morristown Medical Center (FFMMC) is a standalone foundation, which is a not-for-profit fundraising organization that solicits funds in its general appeal for the benefit and support of Atlantic Health System, Inc. and AHS Hospital Corporation (the Corporation), and all subsidiaries thereof. Morristown Medical Center is the principal recipient of the fundraising carried out by FFMMC.

Low income population: we will decrease the mortality rate on low income communities due to Covid-19 pandemic.

# What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?

To do this, you will take advantage of free, accessible data about the patterns of transit traffic in New York City: MTA turnstile data.
http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html. For this initial phase, we will consider 12 weeks of the data of March, April and May 2021.

# What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?

We are planning to use features such as # entries and # exits by zip code, day and hour in order to identify the bussiest stations (dyas and hours) to set the Vaccination Points more effectively.

# If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

We won't be modelling our data on this first phase of the project. Instead, we will be using our data to show some graphics and get initial findings. 

# MVP Goal:

Highly-trafficked stations in low income communities.
